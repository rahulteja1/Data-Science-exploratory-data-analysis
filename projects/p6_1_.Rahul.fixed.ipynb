For the 5-fold cross-validation, we split the data into five parts, and have 5 different training/validation splits.  We build a model for each of the splits using the training part and validation part to evaluate it.  The outcome is five different performance values.  These can be aggregated - compute a mean/median, or use them to estimate a variance over the splits.  \n",

    "Let's now think about doing model selection, but using cross-validation rather than a single split.  The overall idea is illustrated below. We still have the initial split into training and test data.  But rather than a single split into training and validation data, we run cross-validation for each parameter setting.  We record the mean score averaged over the splits in the cross-validation.  After evaluating all candidate paramters, find the one with the best mean performance.  *Keep in mind this score does not correspond to a single model; there is no best model*.  We select the hyper-parameter that is best on average over the splits.  Then we build a new model, using the hyper-parameters that performed best on average in cross-validation, on the full training dataset (X_trainval).  Finally, we evaluate this model on the test data set.   \n",

Cross-validation is a technique to robustly evaluate a particular model on a particular data set.  Grid search is a technique to tune the hyper-parameters of a particular model by brute-force search.  Often each candidate is evaluated using cross-validaiton, but it is not necessary (you could use a single split of training + validation set).  So while cross-validation is often used within a grid search, you can also do cross-validation outside of a grid search, and you can do a grid search without using cross-validation.\n",

Split the data into training and test sets.  For each hyper-parameter candidate, run a grid search on the training set, yielding a score for each split, and a mean score over all splits.  The mean validation scores are used to select the best hyper-parameter value and retrain a model on the whole training data.  Then we evaluate this final model on the test set. \n",

    "A very common error when using cross-validation is data leakage. Data leakage is where information about the holdout dataset, such as a test or validation dataset, is made available to the model in the training dataset.   This is not a direct type of data leakage, where we would train the model on the test dataset. Instead, it is an indirect type of data leakage, where some knowledge about the test dataset, captured in summary statistics is available to the model during training. This can make it a harder type of data leakage to spot, especially for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a problem where we want to normalize the data, that is, scale the data to a range of 0-1.  When we normalize the input variables, this requires that we first calculate the minimum and maximum values for each variable before using these values to scale the variables. The dataset is then split into train and test datasets, but the examples in the training dataset know something about the data in the test dataset; they have been scaled by the global minimum and maximum values, so they know more about the global distribution of the variable then they should.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of data leakage exists with almost any data preparation task, e.g., standardization or even imputation of missing values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*How to solve this issue?*  Data preparation must be fit on the training data set only.  More generally, the entire modeling pipeline must be prepared only on the training dataset to avoid data leakage. This might include data transforms, but also other techniques such feature selection, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering and more. \n",

    "We can get even more advanced with our `GridSearchCV` options, because it can search over grids, and also over lists of grids (a list of dictionaries). This is useful when different pre-processing steps or models have different hyper-parameters. For example, say we wanted to tune whether the `MinMaxScaler` should scale between 0 and 1 or between -1 and 1, while also considering the case of using `StandardScaler`. We can't just add `feature_range` to the `param_grid` dictionary because `StandardScaler` doesn't have a `feature_range` parameter. Instead we can create a list of two grids: one grid that always uses `MinMaxScaler` and one that always uses `StandardScaler`. This is a bit of a contrived example, but once we know more models and transformers there will be plenty of cases where this comes in handy."
